"""
You are given a positive number n.

Return the smallest number x greater than or equal to n,
such that the binary representation of x contains only set bits.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: binary of 7 is "111"

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 15
Explanation: binary of 15 is "1111"

Example 3:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: binary of 3 is "11"

Constraints:
â€¢ 1 <= n <= 1000
