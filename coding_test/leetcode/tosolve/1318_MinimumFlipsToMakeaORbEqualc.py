1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c
Medium

Given 3 positive numbers a, b, and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make (a OR b == c). The flip operation consists of changing any single bit from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

### Example 1:
Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips, a = 1, b = 4, and c = 5, such that (a OR b == c).

### Example 2:
Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
Output: 1

### Example 3:
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0

### Constraints:
- 1 <= a <= 10^9
- 1 <= b <= 10^9
- 1 <= c <= 10^9
